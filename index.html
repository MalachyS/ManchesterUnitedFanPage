						<p >
							Bruno Miguel Borges Fernandes (European Portuguese: [Ààb…æunu f…®…æÀàn…êÃÉd…® É]; born 8 September 1994) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Premier League club
							Manchester United and the Portugal national team. Fernandes is known for his goalscoring, playmaking, leadership, penalty taking, and work rate.[4] Born in Maia, Porto, Fernandes started his career
							at Italian Serie B side Novara but soon made a move to Serie A side Udinese in 2013, followed by Sampdoria three years later. After five years in Italy, he signed with Sporting CP in 2017,
							where he was named club captain. He won back-to-back Ta√ßas da Liga in 2018 and 2019, as well as the Ta√ßa de Portugal, leading to him being named in the Primeira Liga Team of the Year and Primeira
							Liga Player of the Year in both seasons. In 2018‚Äì19, he scored a record of 33 goals in all competitions, making him the highest-scoring Portuguese midfielder and the highest-scoring midfielder in
							Europe in a single season. Fernandes' performances sparked the interest of several Premier League clubs, with Manchester United signing him for an initial ‚Ç¨55 million (¬£47 million) in January 2020,
							becoming at the time, the second-highest fee for a Portuguese player leaving the domestic league. Fernandes is a former Portugal youth international, representing his country at under-19,
							under-20, under-21 and under-23 levels. He represented Portugal at the 2016 Summer Olympics. He made his senior international debut in 2017, being chosen in Portugal's squads for the 2018 FIFA World Cup,

					<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MUFC</a> looking at alternatives to Joao Felix with Atletico demanding at least double what the club are prepared to pay to loan Portugal forward. Not abandoned interest but Atleti/Felix/Mendes position would need to fundamentally shift for deal to be done <a href="https://t.co/FYHuupZ7Nu">https://t.co/FYHuupZ7Nu</a></p>&mdash; James Ducker (@TelegraphDucker) <a href="https://twitter.com/TelegraphDucker/status/1609959253950742529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center>
					<p>United have rejected those terms out of hand and are now looking at alternatives, having told Atletico and Felix‚Äôs agent Jorge Mendes that the deal would have to be substantially cheaper before they would consider 
					returning to the negotiating table. Arsenal and Chelsea have also expressed an interest in the 23-year-old - who cost ¬£113m when he moved to Spain from Benfica in the summer of 2019 - but would be unlikely to meet Atletico‚Äôs
					 demands. United are in the market for a forward in the January transfer window to replace Felix‚Äôs Portugal teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, another high-profile client from the Mendes camp. Having spent a club record ¬£220m on new
					  signings in the summer, Ten Hag has to work on a tighter budget which has also been affected by the uncertainty over United‚Äôs ownership after the Glazer indicated a willingness to sell the club. Sources say there are no live
					   discussions at the moment and that is unlikely to change unless the Spanish club alter their stance.
